# Emergent Gravity: An Open Theory

This project was inspired by a spontaneous and intuitive discussion between a curious human and ChatGPT (OpenAI's assistant) on **April 23, 2025**. It began after encountering a fascinating Facebook article discussing a groundbreaking theory by physicists **Ruth Kastner** and **Andreas Schlatter**, which proposes that **gravity may not be a fundamental force**.

Their theory suggests that gravity emerges from **quantum-level electromagnetic interactions**, specifically **photon exchanges** between charged particles like atoms and molecules. This radical reimagining of gravity aligns with thermodynamic and entropic frameworks, challenging the classical view of gravity as spacetime curvature, as described by Einstein.

## What This Project Is About
This repository explores a personal, intuitive extension of the Kastnerâ€“Schlatter idea, developed through a collaborative discussion with AI. The user proposed that:

- **Gravity could emerge as a pressure response from within space itself**
- As particle density increases in a region, **entropy rises**, forcing space to "push back" in a self-organizing effort to restore balance
- This internal pressure creates **gravitational potential**, suggesting gravity is not a force pulling from without, but **an emergent spatial effect from within**

The theory was visualized and articulated in both scientific and layperson language to help spread the idea freely, in the spirit of open science and universal benefit.

## Project Structure
- `diagram.png`: A conceptual academic diagram illustrating the entropic chain to gravity
- `README.md`: This document
- `Concept with formulas - FIXED`: A conceptual paper illustrating the entropic chain to gravity with formulas
- `emergent_gravity_explained_simply.md`: The concept explained simply, with imagery so non physicists such as myself can understand.

## Mission
This project is **open source and free for all**. Our goal is to:
- Share this concept with independent researchers
- Invite collaboration, criticism, and creative extension
- Foster open innovation in gravity, entropy, energy, and propulsion systems

Together, we dream of a future where open collaboration may lead to:
- Antigravity technologies
- Faster-than-light travel
- Clean, abundant energy off the grid
